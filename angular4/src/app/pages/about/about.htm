              <p>Asynchronous programming is the way to the future.
                CPU's can only get so fast and handle so many threads at once.
              Moving to a non-blocking architecture will allow more request to be made and fulfilled faster with the same amount of cores.
              It does this by decreasing the amount of time the CPU is waiting.
                Meaning that instead of waiting for information to be read from disk, the core could be handling other processes.</p><br/>
              <p>It also prevents the need for servers to spin up a new thread to handle a new IO request.
                Just add the event into the queue and the event loop will get to it! </p>
