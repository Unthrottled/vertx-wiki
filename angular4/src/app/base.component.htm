                    You are also an esteemed writer who has the powers to forge interesting wiki pages from the hot fires of Valhalla.

                  <p *ngIf="cantCreate | async">
                    While you cannot create any pages.
                    You have the ability to enjoy all of the wiki pages that our writers have forged from the burning fires of Valhalla.

                    You may also choose to go back and fully modify a page you and fellow writers have created.
                    May pages never wear to a dull boring edge.

                    Once the steel, to which a page is created, it lie there, until a craftsman above your currnt skills, may place it back into the forge.
                    To which it may be modified again.

                    Lastly, here you are, the mighty "Archiver." Wielding the power to cast created pages down, into the archive.
                    Where they may wait patiently and forever, until you deem they may one day see the light of mainstream.

                    The page keepers of this site have the ability to cast created pages into the archive.
                    Where the pages may lie outside of the realm of active pages.
                    Hoping one day they may be restored.
